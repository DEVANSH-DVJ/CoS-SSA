listpaths
=========

For usage, please give the comment "listpaths --help". The default input 
is stdin and the default output is sdtout. Thus the command 
"listpaths < in.1" works.

A sample input is provided in file in.1 and the corresponding output for
options "-l 25 -d 4 -p" is provided in the file out.1.

The input is a collection of procedures. The structure of a procedure is

 Start NAME StatementList EdgeList End

There must be exactly one procedure with the name "main".


There are three kinds of statements:

        Assignment with binary  expression (or +,-,*,/) on  the RHS. The
        operands on the RHS may be integers or variables.

        Copy  statements. The  operands on  the  RHS may  be integer  or
        variable.

        Call statements for parameterless procedures.

Each statement  is preceded  by a  statement label  ending with  a ":"..
Label must be greater than 0 Label  0 is reserved for empty call string.
(i.e. call to the main by the OS)                                      .

Each edge in the edge list is provided as "n -> m".

Comments begin with "//" and extend up tp the end of the line.

Disclaimers:

        - It is assumed  that the nodes listed with  the statements and
          the  edges  provided,  are consistent with  each  other. The
          program does not try to check this as of now                 

        - It is assumed that the node labels are mutually exclusive even
          across procedures. No check for this has been made.
